This is my first ever writing on a Diary. You know that during Christmas I do get a lot work but my wife does not understand that. I have the dream job that everyone wished for....working a single day a year and doing nothing the rest of the year.

Still, it requires a lot of preparation and delegation of tasks to my little helpers. Every year, gifts get delivered to kids' homes on time and it requires a lot of team effort.

Still, my wife thinks I'm lazy...that is why I am fat in her mind.

**Awesome**, right?
